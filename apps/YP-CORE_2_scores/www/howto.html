    When you open this app you will be seeing something like this.
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_001.png">
    <hr>
    Obviously, the URL won't be '127.0.0.1:4295' and what you see will depend on the browser that you are using 
    and will look fairly different on a 'phone or even a tablet.  The text may also have changed a bit by the 
    time you are using the app, even that list of tabs: 'Upload', 'Data checking' ... may have changed. </p>
    <p>
      However, the basic layout will be something like that.</p>
      <p>The first thing you need to do is to give the app some data to process.  Start by pulling down 
      one of the files shown here:
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_002.png">
    <hr>
      Then, to get used to the app, don't change the data in the file, just upload it into the app.
      You do that using that section of the page saying 'Upload data' and offering you a file selection
      input marked 'Browse...', here:
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_003.png">
    <hr>
      You can pull a file, ideally starting with the one you just downloaded with its artificial data.
      Here you can see that I've done that, uploading YPwide2.csv
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_004.png">
    <hr>
    You can also see there that the app is showing you the default referential data.
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_005.png">
    <hr>
    If you want one of other available referential data you can just select the one you want at any point
    by coming back to this home tab ('Upload') and changing your selection.</p>
    <p>The last options on this home tab are at the bottom of the tab and shown here.</p>
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_006.png">
    <hr>
    The first relates to the fact that, regrettably, there are two ways of scoring some of the CORE measures:
    <ul>
      <li>'Mean' scoring'
      which uses the mean of the item scores allowing prorating of up to 10% missing items 
      (i.e. across nine YP-CORE items if one is missing, but not prorating if more items are missing and ...</li>
      <li>'Clinical' scoring which is the mean score multiplied by 10.</li>
    </ul>
    If you look at the data in one of those example spreadsheets you will see that you can enter data using
    either scoring or even a mixture of the two.  This radio button selection just affects which system the 
    app uses in what it returns.</p>
    <p>The second input control here sets the number of decimal points that the app will use for most of 
    the analyses it provides.  Two is usually sensible but you can change this at any point, i.e. you may 
    be looking at analyses in one of other tabs and you can come back to this tab and reset what you want here.</p>
    <h3>The other tabs</h3>
    Now we have data in and have chosen those basic settings we can get the app to do some work.  This is all 
    done in separate tabs:
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_007.png">
    <hr>
    <h3 id="odd-tabs">The odd tabs</h3>
    There are three 'odd' tabs, i.e. ones that don't do any analyses or manipulation of the data.  We have just been through the home/upload tab.  The other two that <i>aren't</i>
    about analyses are those last two: 'Explanation of the app', and 'Background'. The first of those is what it
    says but not a full how to guide like this and the second covers the copyright/copyleft status of all my
    apps and the history of the app. </p>
    <p>So that brings us to the nuts and bolts of the app.  Currently the tabs are as shown there, others 
      may have been added to the app by the time you are reading this as I hope they'll be pretty self-explanatory.
      The second tab, 'Data checking' is what it says and with the next tab, 'Data' it is not really about
      analyses but about the data itself.</p>
      
    <h3 id="checking">The data checking tab</h3>  
    <p>Here is the top of the 'Data checking' tab:</p>
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_008.png">
    <hr>
    <p>I have framed an area that is present in all the tabs except the 'home/upload' tab: an update/status/suggestions block.
    Do feel free to suggest improvements and to report errors or problems.  I don't promise that I will implement all suggestions
    but I will consider each one. Equally, I can't promise to be able to solve any and all problems people encounter though I 
    will do my best and I will most certainly try to correct any reported errors. This has grown into a pretty huge app with 
    over two thosand lines in the main app and definitely still growing.  I am not a gifted programmer so I am sure frank 
    errors will emerge.  Please report them!</p>
    
    <p>This next block selects rows in the uploaded data that seem to have errors.</p>
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_009.png">
    <hr>
    <p>That screenshot has arrows marking three key parts of this, an interactive 'DT/DataTable'.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first is very self-explanatory as it just controls how many lines of data that appear to contain errors are show
    in the table.  The 'all' option is important if you want to download this table.  More on that below.</li>
      <li>The second is also self-explanatory: you can search across all the fields in the table.  I think that's only 
    likely to be useful to find a particular client by ID.</li>
      <li>The last points to the first of the filters at the head of each column.  These enable you to filter to rows 
      where the value for that column matches what you put in that box.  There's a box for each column as you see.
      So to filter to all rows with errors in the first YP-CORE score, put '1' in the column errScore1.  The column
      'errMesg' should give you a message about the error.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="data-tab">The 'Data' tab: to export your data with age/gender categories</h3>
    <p>This tab allows you to export or copy either all your data with the added variables created by the app.  It uses 
    a searchable and filterable 'DataTable' table to allow you find or filter out a subset of your total
    dataset that you might want to download.</p>
    <p>The tab starts like this.</p>
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_010.png">
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>The 'Explanation' block tells you about filtering and searching</li>
      <li>The 'Download entire data' block does exactly what it says!  Then you have ...</li>
      <li>... the 'Searchable table of the data' again does exactly what it says allowing you
      to look at specific rows in your data and, if you want, copy or export them.  This next 
      screen grab shows that I have selected data for therapist '3' where the gender of 
      client is female ('F') and the age was between 11 and 14.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_011.png">
    <hr>
    
    
    <h3 id="sociodemographics">Sociodemographics</h3>
    At the time of writing this document this tab gives a simple tabulation of the gender breakdown 
    in your data, a similar table of ages and then a histogram plot of the ages.  This looks like this.
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_012.png">
    <hr>
    As you can see there, you can download the histogram in various formats (but the pdf export is
    broken and beyond my skills to hack into the download functions and fix that so don't use it).
    
    <h3 id="by-clinician">Summary statistics by clinician</h3>
    <p>This tab does what it says!  I have reservations about it but I do believe that collaborations
    between clinicians, or services in which a number of clinicians work with clients and record
    change data <i>should</i> want to look at differences in a spirit of curiosity and collaboration.</p>
    <p>This next screen grab shows my to do list with some questions to you, the end users.  Do 
    come back to me with the link there if you have suggestions.</p>
    <p>Then it shows the top of a long table that summarises many things from the data, breaking things
    down by clinician.<br>
    the table is downloadable.</p>
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_013.png">
    <hr>
    
    <h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>
    This tab gives some breakdown of the attendance information in your data as shown in this screen grab.
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_014.png">
    <hr>
    <p>That is followed by histogram of the numbers of sessions attended as shown here.</p>
    <hr>
    <img src="./Screenshot_015.png">
    <hr>
    <p>Unlike the earlier histogram of ages, this is a <i></i>plotly/ggplotly</i> plot.  Plotly plots, 
    which I create with an     R package called ggplotly, have a 'modebar' at the top that appears if 
    you hover your cursor over the plot.  In this screen grab I have marked the text that alerts you 
    to this, with it's hyperlink to 
    <a href="https://plotly.com/chart-studio-help/getting-to-know-the-plotly-modebar/">https://plotly.com/chart-studio-help/getting-to-know-the-plotly-modebar/</a>
    where you can find all you might want to know about this modebar (and probably much more than you
    need!)  I have linked that to the modebar itself and, as I had my cursor hovering over the 'download'
    icon when I took the screen grab, you can see the tooltip explaining the little icon.</p>
    <p>Unlike the histogram of ages, created with a more basic bit of R, this can only be downloaded 
    as a png file but it does seem to work reliably.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Created 9.vii.25</li>
      <li>Last updated 11.vii.25.  Some, still clunky, improvement of the aesthetics.  Contents 
      section added and headings added for all the headings (mostly pointing to tabs in the app).  
      So far I have only done these sections down to the attendance one.  I have also added this 
      history section.</li>
